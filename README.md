## Description
This project involves extending the previously developed software application from Project 3 to be accessible via the web. It utilizes Docker for containerization and Flask for creating web applications. The Flask application will gather user input from a web form and populate an option box with stock symbols.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to enhance knowledge and experience in Docker and Flask environments for producing a functional web application.

## Implementation Details
- **Flask Application**: Utilizes Flask to create a web application interface for the project, replacing the previous command-line interface.
- **Stock Symbols Population**: Code is implemented to dynamically populate the web form with stock symbols.
- **Containerization**: Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring consistency and ease of deployment.
